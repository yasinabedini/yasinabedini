## About me

I am an information security expert working primarily on the Blue Team side, but I also conduct research and training on the Red Team side. My goal is to explore security from both defensive and offensive perspectives.
I have a strong interest in automation, although not in every area.
I share some proof-of-concept (PoC) projects on my GitHub, where my focus is mostly on expanding and sharing knowledge related to the Red Team
